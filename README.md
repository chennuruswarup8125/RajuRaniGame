# Raju Rani Game

A real-time, multiplayer web game inspired by the traditional Indian role-based card game *Raja, Rani, Thief, Police*. Built with modern frontend tools, this game allows players to host and join private rooms, get assigned roles randomly, and play interactively in a turn-based sequence.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

**Raju Rani Game** brings the fun of guessing and strategy from the classic role-play format into a modern web interface. One player becomes the King, others are assigned roles like Queen, Minister, Police, and Thief (depending on the total number of players). The King starts the game by guessing who the Queen is, and gameplay continues turn-by-turn until the Thief is caught.

### 🎯 Objective

Identify the Thief before they escape! Each correct guess earns points, while wrong guesses result in role swaps.
